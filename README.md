# Power-Factor-Correction-Circuit-Using-Boost-Converter
Designed and simulated a 400W boost converter-based PFC circuit to enhance power quality in AC-DC conversion.
Improved Power Factor from 0.207 to 0.884 and reduced THD from 72
Implemented optimized inductor and capacitor design with 5 kHz switching frequency for better efficiency.
Developed both simulation and hardware prototype, validating sinusoidal input current and reduced harmonics
